“Design and Implementation of an Economic Gas Leakage Detector”, - this project was developed to detect the gas leakage and providing immediate alarm or intimation to the user. This project was developed using microcontroller ARM version7 processor and simulated using Keil software \cite{amin2018design}.\\\\
Providing the accurate calculation of the ratio is very important to increase the Electronic nose performance, and the result of this experiment showed that the Artificial neural network method achieves a good performance with smaller RMSE of 0.0433 compared with the existing methods \cite{desai2017iot}.E-nose with MQ Family produces the ratio of existing air and base line air resistance, and it is usually equipped with a datasheet containing the consecration of detected gas in a certain value of the sensor to convert the output to the concentration of detected gas\cite{keshamoni2017smart}.\\\\
The prior is connected with cameras to undergo plant recognition, and utilizes database to find the suitable amount of water; the latter controls the amount of water that is able to flow out \cite{kim2014issaq}. The researchers had developed an irrigation system, with the use of deep learning, that is able to adjust the amounts of water foe each type of plant through plants recognition\cite{dutta2017iot}.\\\\
This paper consists same like previous paper but here Arduino controller is used and detects the LPG gas leakage by gas sensor\cite{sabilla2017estimating} MQ-2 and within a few minutes automatically switch on the exhaust fan and buzzer to provide the alertness to the people. Here GSM SIM900A module is used to send the message to the predefined number so information can be sent and can prevent fire accidents\cite{savitha2018survey,keshamoni2017smart,koduru2018integrated,mahalingam2012design,alekseev2017information}.\\\\
Accordingly, this paper presents a brief overview of solid-state gas sensors, which can be classified into semiconductor, capacitor, and solid-electrolyte type sensors, based on their sensing mechanisms and a simple NDIR instrument\cite{mahalingam2012design}. Furthermore, the sensing properties of solid-state gas sensors to environmental gases, such as NOX, SOX, CO2, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), plus certain other gases, are also classified and summarized\cite{lee2001environmental}.\\\\
The results proven that the step response of the second-order transfer function model can fit to the output signal of the gas sensors for different concentration when the parameters of $\omega/n$ (Natural Frequency), $\zeta$ (Overshoot) and K (Gain), chosen optimally\\cite{alekseev2017information}. This paper presents, the second order transfer function model for the gas sensor’s transient response based on a smaller number of coefficients and equations\cite{kukade2014electronic}.\\\\
The importance of using such a system in Ghana is due to the increased spate of fire outbreaks in homes where at least one or more gas cylinders can be found \cite{kwok2018smart} in 2017 published a research article where the design of an electronic gas leakage monitoring system in real-time is proposed, to alert people in homes and industries in Ghana of gas leakages through persistent text messages with accompanying beeps.\\\\
proposed \cite{karim2018monitoring} an Internet of Things-based cargo monitoring system (IoT-CMS) to monitor any environmental changes of ESPs in order to ensure their functional quality throughout the entire cold chain operational environment. Through applying (i) a wireless sensor network to collect real-time product information, together with (ii) fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning techniques to suggest appropriate storage conditions for various ESPs, effective storage guidance can be established\cite{amuzuvi2017design}.\\\\
The\cite{sethi2017internet} controller is a closed-loop design which uses the soil moisture data to turn on and off the irrigation system based on specified thresholds. The system was developed at the Sensor and Automation Lab of Edisto-REC, Clemson University and then field tested at McCorkle Nurseries in Dearing, GA during summer 2017\cite{tsang2017iot}.The goal of this project was to design a prototype irrigation controller using the internet of things (IoT).\\\\
In this research it also showed how to control actuators over the net by just changing the state wise parameters from “0” to “1” and vice versa for controlling \cite{jokar2016intrusion,}. A research had been done on IoT based cold storage temperature and humidity monitoring, where NodeMCU and Thingspeak platform was used.
